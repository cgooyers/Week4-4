		// EXERCISE 1:
		// Create a variable that receives the user input from the following prompt:
		prompt("What is your favorite food?");

		// Log this sentence into the console:
		// "My favorite food is -----." using the previously 
		// retrieved answer from the prompt
		console.log();

		// EXERCISE 2:
		// Give the variable the starting value of 0.
		var numberOfCookies;
		console.log("I started off with " + numberOfCookies + " cookies.");

		// Add 1 to the current value of the variable,
		// making sure to re-assign the new value to the same variable.


		// Log this sentence into the console:
		// "I baked a cookie. Now I have -- cookie."


		// Subtract 1 from the current value of the variable.
		// Once again, make sure you re-assign the new value to the same variable.


		// Log this sentence into the console:
		// "I just ate a cookie. Now I have -- cookies left."
